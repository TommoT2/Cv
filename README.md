```

**Implementation Tips**
- Generate a simple black and white QR code for better readability[1][4]
- Size the QR code approximately 2.5 x 2.5 cm for optimal scanning[3]
- Place it in the top right corner of your CV, aligned with your contact information
- Ensure high resolution (at least 300 dpi) for print quality[4]

**Professional Enhancement**
- Add a small caption under the QR code: "Scan for LinkedIn Profile"
- Keep the QR code simple without fancy designs to maintain professionalism
- Ensure the code is tested before finalizing your CV[7]

For your specific LinkedIn profile (http://linkedin.com/in/watnedal), create a QR code using a professional generator and maintain consistent branding with your existing CV's clean, professional style. The QR code should be subtle yet visible enough to be easily scanned.
